# smart-lock-esp8266
# Instalation:
# The smart lock system requires an NodeMCU ESP8266 development board and a servo motor.
# Once you have them attach servo motor to GPIO 0 or D3 on ESP8266 board, connect the board to your computer, download arduino IDE, download the source code from this repository and upload the sourco code file to your development board.
# After having the board setup you are all set and can remove the connection from your computer and add a power source like a powerbank to set it up near your door knob. And you can visit http://localhost:80/ to see the switch for the lock.
